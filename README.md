### 1.	Login & Register
[Users: Login -- administrator, employee	Register -- employee]
The purpose of this functionality is to ensure the security of the inventory system. By having this functionality, the user can only use this system when it login or registers in this system. Hence, unauthorized access can be prevented and the content in this system will not be maliciously changed or modified. By including different access level, for the administrator and employee, we can decide the scope of the functionality based on their role. For instance, if a product would like to be deleted, this action should be done by the administrator but not any employee. In this system, the user will be given choices of login based on role or register. If login is chosen, the user will be given three attempts. If a user failed to login after three attempts, the system will be closed to prevent an infinite loop. For registration, the new user which is the new employee can register a new account to use this system. If the IC number key in is exist in the employee file, the system may give another selection for forget username and password to the user.

### 2.	Forget username or password
[Users: administrator, employee]
The purpose for this feature is to let the user which has an account but accidentally forget their username and/or password validate their identity by key in their name and IC number in order to change their username and password. By having this feature, users can have a chance to change their account information rather than create a new account. This function will be used either by selecting the options in the login or register page or during the registration process, if the IC key in by user is exist, the system will prompt them whether they forget their username and password or not. 

### 3.	Manage product, transaction and vendor
[Users: administrator, employee]
The purpose of this feature is to manage the product in the inventory system. The functions of managing products, transactions and vendors include adding new products, updating products, transactions, and vendors information, and deleting products and vendors. Hence, when a user tries to retrieve product, transaction and vendor data, the accuracy of data can be guaranteed due to the presence of unique identifiers which are product ID, transaction ID, and vendor ID. Besides, the product, vendor name is all stored in text file in capital letter. When the user input the name of the product and vendors, the alphabets will be changed to upper case in order to find the information in the data text file. Hence, both lowercase letters and capital letters can be used to find the information desired to be get by the user. For the update function, it is mainly use in updating information such as vendor contact number, product minimum quantity level, current stock remains in product, product price, stock in and out amount and so on in order to ensure that the information inside the text files is timely and adjust according to situation. For deleting functionality in product, it will only change the status of product to inactive as the user may need to retrieve old transaction and inventory records. By having this product status, the information of product can still be retrieved although it is deleted (inactive). After done using the functionality chosen, the user will be redirected to the modification page that contains other functionalities until they click exit to return to either admin or employeeâ€™s main menu page. 

### 4.	Display low stock product

In this feature, the user can choose to search the desired object by key in different information such as ID or name. By having the different scope, it will be easier for the user to find the desired object rather than only depending on the name as the user may accidentally remember wrong the name of desired object to be found.
